# Privacy Policy for Twitch Trendy Games Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: [Oct 10 2024]**

## Introduction
Thank you for using the **Twitch Trendy Games** Chrome Extension. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when using this extension. We aim to be transparent about how your information is used.

## Information We Do Not Collect
We do not collect any personal information, browsing history, or data from your device while you use the Twitch Trendy Games extension. The extension solely interacts with the Twitch API to fetch trending game data. No personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted from your device to any external service by us.

## Payments and Subscriptions
The extension uses **ExtensionPay** to handle payments and subscriptions for accessing premium features. **ExtensionPay** is an abstraction over **Stripe**, a third-party payment processor.

While **we do not collect any payment information**, **Stripe** may collect certain personal and payment information when you make a purchase. This data collection is handled entirely by Stripe via ExtensionPay, and we have no access to it.

For more information about Stripe's data handling practices, please refer to [Stripe's Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).

## Third-Party Services
The extension uses the following third-party services:

- **Twitch API**: We fetch game data from the Twitch platform to display the most popular games being streamed at any given moment. No user-specific data is collected, sent, or stored by our extension when interacting with the Twitch API.
  
- **ExtensionPay**: This is used for managing in-app purchases and subscriptions. ExtensionPay relies on Stripe for payment processing, and you can view Stripe's privacy policy to understand their data collection practices.

## Data Security
While no data is collected or stored by us, we take the security of your experience seriously. We ensure that all communication between the extension and third-party services such as Twitch and ExtensionPay is encrypted using secure HTTPS protocols.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with the updated date at the top of this document. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how your data is handled.
